# Lidar and Wall Detection Configuration
#
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the LiDAR system and wall detection.
# All distance measurements are in meters unless otherwise specified.
#
# Transform Configuration:
# - Defines the 6-DOF transform from base_link to the LiDAR frame
# - x, y, z: Translation in meters
# - roll, pitch, yaw: Rotation in radians
#
# Point Cloud Converter Settings:
# - buffer_duration: Time window for accumulating points (seconds)
# - publish_rate: Frequency of point cloud publication (Hz)
#
# Wall Detection Settings:
# - crop_min/max_x/y/z: Bounding box limits for point cloud filtering (meters)
# - min_wall_points: Minimum number of points for wall detection
# - debug_output: Enable or disable detailed debugging output (true/false)
